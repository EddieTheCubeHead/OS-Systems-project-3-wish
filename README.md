# OS-Systems-project-3-wish
A simple shell for the LUT-university operating systems/system programming course

Build the project with the command 'make' and after that run the shell with command './wish [file1] [file2] ... [fileN]'.

Use 'path path1 [path2] ... [pathN]' to specify paths

Use 'cd directory' to move to another directory

Use 'exit' to exit the shell.

Per project instructions the shell doesn't support relative paths/local commands so you need to
add everything to path if you want to run them.
